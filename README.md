Welcome to my calculator project~!
Pseudocode:
// create a function "operate" that takes an operator and 2 numbers and calls a math function to them - DONE
// create a function that populates the display with the numbers pressed - DONE
// figure out how to get multiple numbers to enter input at once
// create a function for = called evaluate that gets an initial number input, then gets an operator, then gets a second number input
